      This is "person Bingo". It's a super cool way to get to know whoever else you've been
      convinced to play with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike normal Bingo, in order <strong
        >to "mark" a cell, you will need to find a person that matches the prompt inside of it</strong
      >. For example, if B1 says "owns a motorcycle", then you would need to find someone who owns a
      motorcycle, then put there name into the text box in B1.
    </p>

      In order to win, you will need to meet the <strong>Win Condition</strong> displayed to the top
      right of the board. In "standard" mode, for example, you could win if fill in B1 through B5
      with 5 <strong>different</strong> names!
    </p>

      A final note: <strong>nothing</strong> that you put into this website will leave your computer!
      All of the information is stored locally, and no one else has any way of seeing it.
